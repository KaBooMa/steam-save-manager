# save-manager
A python program for adding new game / multiple character support to Steam games
# Disclaimer
While I have done my best to test this extensively with my saves, I can make no guarantee that no damage will happen to your saves. I will do my best to keep this software updated with any bug fixes, but I am not responsible for data loss as a result of this too. This is for people like me who are willing to risk incompatibility with game servers to restore this functionality to my games.
# Installation
Requires Python 3
